              Hey! I&apos;m Harry, if you haven&apos;t already gathered that by
              now. I&apos;m an adventurer turned designer from Banbury,
              Oxfordshire. Where I specialise in branding, graphic and web design, 
              and most recently implementing AI tooling but
              love building with whatever tools are right for the job and pushing the boundaries.

              I currently freelance for Giantleap and Cluego as an Events manager 
              but I also design and build exhibition stands from time to time (once a creative,
              always a creative) with a passion for creating experiences.

              Outside of work, I love to workout, paddleboard & play rugby. Any given Saturday
              you&apos;ll find me tackling or paddling away my problems ‚òÅÔ∏è I
              take AAA courses online at the moment if you&apos;re looking to implement!

              I&apos;m passively looking for new positions where I can merge my
              love for design with my love for the outdoors. If you think
              you&apos;ve got an opening that I might like, let&apos;s connect
